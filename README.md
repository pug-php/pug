Pug.php adds inline PHP scripting support to the [Pug](http://jade-lang.com) template compiler.

> Pug has been recently re-named from Jade. If you're new to Pug, you should install the pug-php/pug package on composer.

##### [The Pug Syntax Reference](https://github.com/pugjs/pug#readme)

## Implementation details

The fork is a complete rewrite, all the code is ported from the original jade project.

All the features from the original are supported but undertested, including inheritance
and mixins.

### Install using composer
```sh
composer require pug-php/pug
composer install
```
[pug-php/pug on packagist.org](https://packagist.org/packages/pug-php/pug)

### Pug in your favorite framework

Phalcon: https://github.com/kylekatarnls/jade-phalcon

Symfony: https://github.com/kylekatarnls/jade-symfony

CodeIgniter: https://github.com/kylekatarnls/ci-jade

### Pug options

Pug options should be passed to the Jade construction

```php
$pug = new Pug(array(
    'prettyprint' => true,
    'extension' => '.pug',
    'cache' => 'pathto/writable/cachefolder/'
);
```

### Supports for local variables

```php
$pug = new Pug();
$output = $pug->render('file', array(
    'title' => 'Hello World'
));
```

### Supports for custom filters

Filters must be callable: It can be a class that implements the *__invoke()* method, or an anonymous function.

```php
$pug->filter('escaped', 'My\Callable\Class');

// or

$pug->filter('escaped', function($node, $compiler){
    foreach ($node->block->nodes as $line) {
        $output[] = $compiler->interpolate($line->value);
    }
    return htmlentities(implode("\n", $output));
});
```

#### Built-in filters

* :css
* :php
* :javascript
* :escaped
* :cdata

#### Install other filters with composer

http://pug-filters.selfbuild.fr/

#### Publish your own filter

https://github.com/kylekatarnls/jade-filter-base#readme

### Check requirements

To check if all requirements are ready to use Pug, use the requirements method:
```php
$pug = new Pug(array(
    'cache' => 'pathto/writable/cachefolder/'
);
$missingRequirements = array_keys(array_filter($pug->requirements(), function ($valid) {
    return $valid === false;
}));
$missings = count($missingRequirements);
if ($missings) {
    echo $missings . ' requirements are missing.<br />';
    foreach ($missingRequirements as $requirement) {
        switch($requirement) {
            case 'streamWhiteListed':
                echo 'Suhosin is enabled and ' . $pug->getOption('stream') . ' is not in suhosin.executor.include.whitelist, please add it to your php.ini file.<br />';
                break;
            case 'cacheFolderExists':
                echo 'The cache folder does not exists, please enter in a command line : <code>mkdir -p ' . $pug->getOption('cache') . '</code>.<br />';
                break;
            case 'cacheFolderIsWritable':
                echo 'The cache folder is not writable, please enter in a command line : <code>chmod -R +w ' . $pug->getOption('cache') . '</code>.<br />';
                break;
            default:
                echo $requirement . ' is false.<br />';
        }
    }
    exit();
}
```
